YOU CAN USE THE DIGITAL SCORING CODE ON UPDATED YEARS 
BASED ON THIS REPORT: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/digitalization-and-the-american-workforce/
This code and data downloads O*Net scores from 2019-2024
We use 2023 scores in the Inclusion piece (not published yet as of authorship of this file)
https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#individual-files
The relevant files are Knowledge and Work activities 

This file downloads 2023 Lightcast data at the state, Metro, and national level
It combined that with 2032 O*net scores and Census data 
Then it creates summary statistics and graphics using these data.
Private data sources like Lightcast are known for their routine quarterly updates, revising numbers spanning from employment and wages to job postings. (Figures and numbers retrieved today for, say, 2022, may vary from those obtained three months later due to routine updates.) If you have any inquiries regarding the data and methodologies, please don't hesitate to reach out to Yang.
